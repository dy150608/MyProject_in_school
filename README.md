# my practice project
just for fun(也就是说闲的吧，无所谓写点什么，灌灌水啦)



the first project(greedy snake) was write in 2018.2, when I was in sophomore.

At that time, my coding level was so low. But now, haha~ I'm growing up. I will upload my code in following time.



the second project(mpthree) was a music player, which write in 2019.8, when I was in fieldwork.

This program had some bugs I have not solved. Playing in final, a error of memory overflow.



the third project(black and white chess) had commits, which write in 2019.8.25, when I was in tranning.

This program had some bugs and problems I have not solved, but I won't repeat its at all. I dislike write GUI.



the fourth project(Mplayer)was a music player with GUI, which write in 2019.9.10, when I was in tranning.

This program is a mutil-threads project, I think is a project that I written best now. Sure, it has rough GUI, and have a bug that when user seek in end of music, the program would die. But, I really do not wanna to fix it up.
