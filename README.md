# my practice project
just for fun(也就是说闲的吧，无所谓写点什么，灌灌水啦)

the first project(greedy snake) was write in 2018.2, when I was in sophomore.
At that time, my coding level was so low. But now, haha~ I'm growing up. I will upload my code in following time.

the second project(mpthree) was a music player, which write in 2019.8, when I was in fieldwork.
This program had some bugs I have not solved. Playing in final, a error of memory overflow.
